## [Project #1: Major League Baseball Strikezone Prediction (IN PROGRESS)](https://github.com/etsc9287/Strikezone-Project)

The objective of this project is to predict whether or not a pitch will be thrown in the strikezone based on a variety of factors from before the pitch is airborne. 
If MLB batters and their coaches are aware of the diverse factors influencing whether or not a pitch will be thrown in the strikezone, batters will have a better idea of when to swing and when not to swing.  This project can also assist pitchers in being aware of their pitch predictability.  The process of this project includes the following:

1. Importing and merging [multiple datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/pschale/mlb-pitch-data-20152018) into **Python** from Kaggle.com, representing game data, atbat data, and pitching data.
2. Cleaning and engineering a new dataset with a large number of features that play a role in predicting the binary strikezone flag.
3. Performing exploratory data analysis.
4. Building both a general model and a player-specific model with classification methods such as logistic regression.
5. Evaulating models with measures such as accuracy score, precision, recall, ROC-AUC curves, and f1.
6. Hyperparameter optimization.


## [Project #2: Analyzing the 2019 Kaggle Data Science Survey to Compare Python and R Users](https://www.kaggle.com/etsc9287/python-vs-r-the-data-science-rivalry)   

The objective of this project is to compare Kaggle.com's Python and R users, including users of both and neither languages, in various areas including demographics, learning sources, career, machine learning, and more.  With the usage of these analytics, data science enthusiasts, especially beginners, can determine which language(s) to learn or focus on based on their personal situations.  Alternatively, this analysis can also be used to determine a data science enthusiast's best course of action based on the language(s) they already prefer.  The process of this project includes the following:

1. Importing the [2019 Kaggle Data Science Survey Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/kaggle-survey-2019) into **R** from Kaggle.com.
2. Analyzing univariate distributions of variables involving programming language-related survey questions (the target variable) in order to gain an initial understanding of which language (including libraries) is most popular.
3. Analyzing univariate distributions of variables I will be relating to Python/R usage in order to gain an understanding of the data's balance.
4. Using well-detailed and easily understandable bivariate visualizations to illustrate the relationships between a variety of variables and Python/R usage.
5. Using R Markdown to effectively communicate findings and create a comprehensive report.

**Note:** This project was apart of a Kaggle analytics competition in which participants could choose any topic of focus to analyze from the survey.  My notebook was the 19th most liked in the competition and is currently my top Kaggle project.  My other projects involving Kaggle datasets can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/etsc9287/notebooks).
