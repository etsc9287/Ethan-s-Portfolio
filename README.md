## [Project #1: MLB Strikezone Prediction](https://github.com/etsc9287/Strikezone-Project)

The objective of this project is to predict whether or not a pitch will be thrown in the strikezone based on a variety of factors from before the pitch is airborne. 
If MLB batters and their coaches are aware of the diverse factors influencing where a pitch may be thrown, batters will have a better idea of when to swing and when not to swing.  This project may also assist pitchers in being aware of their pitch predictability.  The process of this project includes the following:

1. Importing [multiple datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/pschale/mlb-pitch-data-20152018) from Kaggle.com, as large as 4 million rows.
2. Engineering and cleaning a new dataset with a large number of features that play a role in predicting the binary strikezone flag.
3. Performing exploratory data analysis.
4. Building both a general model and a player-specific model with classification methods such as logistic regression and boosting.
5. Evaulating models with measures such as accuracy score and f1.
6. Hyperparameter optimization.
