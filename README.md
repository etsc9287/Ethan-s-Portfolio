## [Project #1: Major League Baseball Strikezone Prediction](https://github.com/etsc9287/Strikezone-Project)

The objective of this project is to predict whether or not a pitch will be thrown in the strikezone based on a variety of factors from before the pitch is airborne. 
If MLB batters and their coaches are aware of the diverse factors influencing whether or not a pitch will be thrown in the strikezone, batters will have a better idea of when to swing and when not to swing.  This project can also assist pitchers in being aware of their pitch predictability.  The process of this project includes the following:

1. Importing and merging [multiple datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/pschale/mlb-pitch-data-20152018) into **Python** from Kaggle.com, representing game data, atbat data, and pitching data.
2. Cleaning and engineering a new dataset with a large number of features that play a role in predicting the binary strikezone flag.
3. Building both a general model and a player-specific model with the **logistic regression** algorithm.
4. Evaulating models with measures such as accuracy score, precision, recall, ROC-AUC curves, and f1.
5. Tuning classification thresholds by both accuracy and practicality.


## [Project #2: How Did COVID-19 and Demographics Shape the 2020 Election? (COMING SOON)](https://github.com/etsc9287/Election_Project)

Throughout the past 8 months, the COVID-19 pandemic has affected Americans' way of life and was the key issue throughout the presidential race between incumbent president Donald Trump and challenger Joe Biden.  Donald Trump won the 2016 election, but lost the 2020 election as the devistation caused by the pandemic was widely considered a significant factor in his loss.  The objective of this project is to analyze data from the 2016 election, 2020 election, and COVID-19 statistics by US county in order to determine how the pandemic and demographic factors affected the outcome of the election.  The process of this project includes the following:

1. Importing and merging multiple datasets into **Python** from Kaggle.com, representing 2016 and 2020 presidential election results data by US county, COVID-19 case and death rates by US county, gender and racial demographics by US county, and spatial data of the counties.
2. Analyzing summary statistics regarding demographics, COVID-19 cases and deaths, and the 2016 and 2020 elections by state and county.
3. Analyzing the shift in vote preference by state and county from 2016 to 2020, as well as analyzing whether or not COVID-19 case and death rates in these states and counties correlated with the shift.
4. Analyzing how demographics and their shifts correlated with voter preference in both 2016 and 2020.
5. Running a **linear regression** model, along with other regression models, to predict county voter preferences in 2020 based on the combined factors of county demographic changes, the 2016 results, and COVID-19 statistics.
 

## [Project #3: Analyzing the 2019 Kaggle Data Science Survey to Compare Python and R Users](https://www.kaggle.com/etsc9287/python-vs-r-the-data-science-rivalry)   

The objective of this project is to compare Kaggle.com's Python and R users, including users of both and neither languages, in various areas including demographics, learning sources, career, machine learning, and more.  With the usage of these analytics, data science enthusiasts, especially beginners, can determine which language(s) to learn or focus on based on their personal situations.  Alternatively, this analysis can also be used to determine a data science enthusiast's best course of action based on the language(s) they already prefer.  The process of this project includes the following:

1. Importing the [2019 Kaggle Data Science Survey Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/kaggle-survey-2019) into **R** from Kaggle.com.
2. Analyzing univariate distributions of variables involving programming language-related survey questions (the target variable) in order to gain an initial understanding of which language (including libraries) is most popular.
3. Analyzing univariate distributions of variables I will be relating to Python/R usage in order to gain an understanding of the data's balance.
4. Using well-detailed and easily understandable bivariate visualizations to illustrate the relationships between a variety of variables and Python/R usage.
5. Using R Markdown to effectively communicate findings and create a comprehensive report.

**Note:** This project was apart of a Kaggle analytics competition in which participants could choose any topic of focus to analyze from the survey.  My notebook was the 19th most liked in the competition and is currently my top Kaggle project.  My other projects involving Kaggle datasets can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/etsc9287/notebooks).
